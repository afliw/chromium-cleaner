# Chromium Cleaner

Simple extension to clean up all browsing history on Chromium/Chrome browser on startup or **exit.

** Couldn't make it work on exit, to make it work it's necessary to enable the __Settings > System > Continue running background apps when Chromium is closed__ (setting I don't want to have enabled in my browser).

To use it, you can just download the __CRX__ in this repository or load the unpacked extension using the __src__ folder.
